# Distractible Leader

This project is a simple "leaderboard" for the [Distractible Podcast][0].

The podcast has a simple premise. Each episode there is a host/judge and two "presenters" who will present their ideas to the host/judge. The judge will dish out points mostly for the content of the idea but bonus points can be given for just about anything the host desires.

Whoever ends up with the most points at the end of the episode will be declared the victor and will get to host/judge the following episode. Because of this format, I think it would be neat to have a site that tracks the points given across the life of the show.
